# TronGame

I took a 2D game from the site - https://grantjenks.com/docs/freegames/tron.html
I want to improve it, I have already made changes in the new version.
To start the game, you need to install the library - freegames

Change log v0.1:
#Changed the control, added more convenient control with the help of arrows
#Changed the colors of the players
#Added mines
#Added nicknames

Change log v0.02:
#Added advanced setting: now the player can set the color of snakes and mines
